<h1 align="center">how to contribute</h1>

## Steps:

### Installation & Configuration:

- `clone` the repository to the device where
intend to work


### Encoding:

> Attention do not write, change or delete anything in the
code from the main branch (default), to any
new functionality must create a new branch

- To create a new branch run the `git command
checkout -b <branch-name>`
    - To switch from one branch to an existing one
in your local repository run `git checkout
<branch-name>` without the `-b`

- After you've finished coding on the new branch,
send it to GitHub with `git push -u origin
<name-of-branch>`
    - After this step, open a pull-request for the
branch main and wait for Admin to analyze and merge
of the pull-request
